### A repository of bayesian modeling and Bayesian Neural Networks


Bayesian modeling unlocks narrative explanations of data, hence the efficacy to drive decision making.  
Bayesian Neural Networks incorporate uncertainty in predictions, mitigating overfitting and making over-confident predictions in conventional neural networks.
